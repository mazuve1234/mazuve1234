### Hello, my name is Mario Mateo ZuÃ±iga Vera ðŸ‘‹

  Iâ€™m a 22 years old peruvian and after 2 years in the world of Industrial Engineering, I decided to transition to the tech industry because of its big impact around           the   world and how it has changed societyâ€™s lifestyle. I find resolving programming problems to be fun and rewarding and hope to develop applications and web        pages by       utilizing the skills Iâ€™ve learned.
